Week 3

Code Challenge: 

Create a simple device that uses the two onboard buttons (BUTTON A and BUTTON B) as toggle switch inputs and the NeoPixels as OUTPUT

1. Button A should Turn the Device ON and OFF

2. Button B should cycle through 8 colors (one click to change the color)

3. Long presses on button A decreases the brightness of the color and long presses on button increases the brightness of the color. (hint: you can use pixels.brightness to control brightness independently from the color value)

4. Make a State Machine Diagram for the device as well!
